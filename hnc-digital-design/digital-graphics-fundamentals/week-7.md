Open White Flag.jpg

* Import Scotland Flag.webp
* Change the colours of the Scotland Flag to those of the Jamaican flag using the Fill tool
* We will set the Layer Effect of to Multiply
* We will go to Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Warp
* We will then use quick select on the white flag
* Apply a Mask to the other flag layer
* Apply a Drop Shadow to the Flag

Then we will look at a photo montage, here is an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck6CmaPZnzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck6CmaPZnzQ)  
If we have time we will start our own in class - if not I would like you to do this as homework  
Start by appropriately sourcing two images that we can build a scene from and then we can begin working on them  
Many Thanks
