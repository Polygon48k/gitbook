### Introduction

The Introduction sets out what you have been asked to do, and, what you will do. If you are writing an essay about ducks, then you would begin your introduction as follows

"I have been asked to write a 100 word essay on the life and anatomy of ducks. I will break this important topic down into the headings, 'beak', 'wings' and 'feathers'. By the end of this essay I am hopeful that I will have discovered the essential essence of duck kind and will present it thus."

### Conclusion

The conclusion is where you summarize your findings and add an element of self critique. If you are writing an essay about ducks, then you might begin your conclusion as follows

"I have found that the key denominating feature in identifying ducks is their particular love of water. As part of this task I found lot's of new information and have enjoyed the process."

### Bibliography

The College uses the Harvard Referencing style 

[https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/t4-media/one-web/university/library/how-to/UHI-SRG-2014-ENG-FINAL.pdf](https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/t4-media/one-web/university/library/how-to/UHI-SRG-2014-ENG-FINAL.pdf)

This means that any references used should be put in short form after making your point, and, then in long form at the end of the report on a separate page entitled 'Bibliography'

#### Short Form

The Correct name for the species commonly referred to as ducks is Anatidae. \(Brasher, 2019\)

\(Author Name, Year of Publication\)

#### Long Form
