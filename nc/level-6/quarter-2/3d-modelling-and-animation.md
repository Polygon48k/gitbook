#### Evidence Requirements <a id="evidence-requirements"></a>

1. Create a Plan

* Draw an Object from [three extreme views and one perspective view](http://portfolio.newschool.edu/eugenescollegelife/files/2015/03/Chang_SpoonTD-1po3nja-212x300.jpg)
* Produce a Schedule
* Produce a [Storyboard](https://tutor.neocities.org/Storyboard.doc)

2. Produce a minimum of one 3D Object and an environment

* Model a 3D Object and an environment
* Texture a 3D Object and an environment
* Light a 3D Object and an environment

3. Animate a 3D Scene

* Apply animation to the object
* Render 3D Scene to a Video file
*  Use the graph editor

4. Evaluate a 3D animated sequence.

* Justify the effectiveness of the sequence in relation to produced plans, citing strengths and weaknesses and methodologies used.
* Justify any alterations required if applicable.
* Identify areas of improvement.

Animation must be a minimum of 15 seconds

## 3D Objects <a id="3d-objects"></a>

3D objects are made up of point called vertices. These point are joined together by lines called edges. Two or more edges can be filled to create a Face.

## 3D Modelling <a id="3d-modelling"></a>

Box Modelling

In box modelling we use a cube and extrude points outwards and inwards to create a rough form, detail is then added using edge loops and tweaking topology

Sculpting

In the Sculpting Workflow we start with a high poly blob and use sculpting tools to define the form - we don't worry about topology until later

Scanning

We can scan objects into the computer by using a laser scanner or an array of photos - Scanned object have poor topology

## Texturing <a id="texturing"></a>

In order to give objects colour and details we need to texture them.

We can use Vertex Painting to apply just colour

We can use an existing image tiled across a surface

We can UV unwrap the model to apply texture detail in specific locations

We can use a texture painting feature

We can use procedural textures

We can layer various materials to create a more realistic surface

We can use normal maps to 'bake' in surface data

We can use specularity maps to simulate reflection

We can use a Physically Based Rendering \( PBR \)

## Lighting <a id="lighting"></a>

We always want our subject to be well visible and clear on the screen

Most commonly - a three point lighting system is used

We can use simple real-time lights to illuminate our scene

We can use a ray-tracing system to simulate real light

We can use forced lighting

## Animation <a id="animation"></a>

3D Animation can be achieved in a number of ways

We can create keyframes at different times to vary the location, scale and rotation of an object

We can control surface topology over time used shape keys

We can control mesh deformation by using a skeletal rig
