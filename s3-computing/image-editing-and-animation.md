## Task 1

Use photopea.com to edit image on different layers. You can search for images on google - right click and copy image - and then hit Ctrl-V to paste into photopea

Once you have finished a multi-layer image you can export as a .jpg by going to File &gt; Export

Clicking "transform controls" will make it easier to move images around

## Task 2

Create a 10 second animation using [https://piskelapp.com/p/create](https://piskelapp.com/p/create) and export the animation as a .gif

## Task 3

Import your .gif file into the wevideo.com editor - you will need to click on the media tab and then on the green cloud to upload your .gif

You can then add free sound from within wevideo, or, import from another location

You can then click Finish in order to export a finished video file

## Layers

Layers allow us to placement elements on top of or below each other - they us allow us to easily name and organize individual elements of an image

## Animation

Animation is imbuing an object with the Illusion of life - basic animation can be moving shapes around on a screen

You will use low resolution images to create an animation of your choosing - if you are new to animation good ideas are objects that have simple movements like Planes, cars and trains.

If you have animated before you may wish to use a character - it is important not to be too ambitious though, and keep the scope of our project achievable

## Video Editing

We can slice up parts of our video and move them around, we can also add titles. For this task the most important thing is that we are able to add some sounds

## Adding Sound

In the video editor it is simple to drag and drop sounds into the timeline, we can then move them around as needed.

Here are some good resources to find sound effects
