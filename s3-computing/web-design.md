# Web Design

## What you need to do

* Come up with an idea for a website
* Design a website with multiple pages - include desktop and mobile
* Code a website

We can use a wire frame to help us design a website

#### HTML \( Hyper-text Mark-up Language \) 

HTML is used to put content onto a website - here we can add text, images and videos

#### CSS \( Cascading Style Sheets \)

CSS is used to style the content - this is what we use to move the content around and to make everything look nice

## Image Formats

There are multiple image formats that we can use on our websites - some are more suited to certain tasks than others though
