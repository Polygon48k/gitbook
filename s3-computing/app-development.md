# App Development

## What you need to do

* Come up with an idea for an App
* Create an App Mock-up including and icon, splash and wire-frame

## Web Apps

Web Apps have similar functionality as native Apps but they are not run on the users device. They are normally built using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

Advantages

* No install time
* Same across devices

Disadvantages

* Slow performance
* Limited Features

## Native Apps

Native Apps are written specifically for the users device and will be installed onto them, taking up storage space.

Advantages

* Fast performance
* Advanced Features

Disadvantages

* Takes up space
* Different across devices

## Wire-frame

Wire-frames are basically sketches of what a finished App will look like, they have a minimal amount of detail and allow us to concentrate on layout and design. Images are represented by Boxes with an X through them

## In App Purchases

More an more we see App's use the Freemium model. This means they are free to get started with, but you can then unlock more features by paying a fee.

There is nothing inherently wrong with this model - However, it is often used to take advantage of a user and take their money

It is important that we are aware that In App Purchases have the potential to cost us thousand of pounds. We should always make sure that we need to enter a password or biometric to access pay content.

## Mobile Operating Systems

The two largest mobile operating systems for mobile devices are iOS and Android.

The current versions are iOS 12 and Android Pie

By keeping our devices up to date with the newest OS version, we can help avoid security concerns.

However - most Apps are only compatible with a certain OS version

## Phone Permissions and Sensors

Modern Apps have access to all sorts of sensors included in our phones - it is important that we know what each of these is when we are allowing permissions

* Accelerometer - detects movement
* Gyroscope - detects orientation
* NFC - allows payments
* Bluetooth - connect to devices
* Wifi - Connect to Internet
* Microphone - Listen to and record you
* Camera - See You and record you
