You MUST document each part of your task with screenshots in a word document. This includes checking code - researching company names, employee information, researching help.

The final part of the task includes using a tool that is included in KALI linux - we will load this up together and complete the final part as a group.

There may be multiple prongs of attack - so we should document all dead ends also.

**Ethics**

Having the ability to penetrate a system raises all sorts of ethical questions. One should not attempt to access a system without prior authorization. Much debate has been had about the limits on Police and Governmental programmes.

**Penetration**

**KALI Linux**

[KALI Linux](https://www.kali.org/) is a linux distribution preloaded with hacking and forensics tools.

You will have the opportunity to run many of these tools
