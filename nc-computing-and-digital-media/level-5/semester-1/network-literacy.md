**Evidence Requirements**

1. You will complete a test to show that you can;
   * Explain the function of network systems and network devices.
   * Use networks safely and responsibly.
2. You will connect a device to a Network - It is essential that you properly document this task - You can use can use screenshots from your device
   * Your device disconnected from any network \( disable Wi-fi and network \)
   * List of available Networks
   * Show Network details of your chosen network
   * Connect to Network \( show this in quick settings \)
   * The West Highland College Website Loaded in your Browser

**Network Topology** Networks can use a range of different physical topologies **Ring**  Advantages • Easy to predict how long data will take to arrive • Secure

Disadvantages • A broken ring will stop all transmissions \(Dual Ring can minimise this problem.\) •A device must wait for an empty token to be able to transmit

**Star**  Advantages • Easy to connect a computer to the network. • New nodes can be added without shutting the network down. • Easy to detect faults and to remove parts.

Disadvantages • Requires more cable than a bus topology. • If the hub fails, the whole network fails • The hub costs money.

**Mesh**

Advantages • Very Reliable.

Disadvantages • Expensive • Difficult to install • Difficult to manage • Difficult to find the location of a problem.

**Bus**  Advantages • Easy to connect a node to the bus. • New nodes can be added without shutting the network down. • Requires less cable than other topologies.

Disadvantages • Entire network shuts down if there is a break in the main cable. • Terminators are required at both ends of the Bus. • Difficult to identify where the problem is if the network shuts down.

**Tree**

Advantages • Easy to connect a node to the network. • New nodes can be added without shutting the network down. • Easy to detect faults and to remove parts.

Disadvantages • Requires more cable than a bus topology. • If a connector fails, some of the network fails • Management can get messy

**Network Types**

WAN \( Wide Area Network \) A computer network that extends over a large geographical distance

LAN \( Local Area Network \) A computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a building or school.

PAN \( Personal Area Network \) A Computer network that interconnects personal devices - such as headsets or printers

MAN \( Metropolitan Area Network \) A City wide computer network

**Equipment**

Cable

RJ45

Wire Crimpers
