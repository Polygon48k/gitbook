## EXIF

Exchangable Image File Format

EXIF is a type of metadate and often includes details such as the settings used to take the photograph or even the location

## Histogram

Histograms are a graphical visualisation of the information contained in an image - often broken down into Red, Green and Blue Layers. When the peaks are skewed to the left the image is probably too dark and when they are skewed to the left the image is probably to bright

## Raw

Raw is a format that includes all of the data from the camera that has only been lightly processed, this means the filesize is large, but, there is a much greater opportunity to make adjustments to the image at a later date - Raw files are sometimes called Digital Negatives.

.cr2 is the Canon raw format

.nef is the Nikon raw format

.dmg is the Adob raw format

## JPEG

Joint Photographic Experts Group

Jpgs are the most common file format for sharing images online

They use a lossy form of compression that means that some information is ultimatley thrown away

You do have granular control over the compression though, so you can choose how large you want to the file to be

## TIFF

## Composition

### Rule of Thirds

### Golden Ratio

### Negative Space

## Exposure Triangle

### ISO

ISO is a setting that can increase the exposure of an image but at the cost of additional noise

### Aperture

The aperture effects the focal range of the image, a lower value will also let in more light

### Shutter Speed

This is the amount of time that the sensor is active, short intervals are good for fast moving subjects like sports

Long intervals will allow lot's more light in but will generally need a tripod
