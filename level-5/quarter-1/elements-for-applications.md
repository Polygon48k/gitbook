# Digital Media Elements for Applications

[https://www.sqa.org.uk/files/nu/F1KS11.pdf](https://www.sqa.org.uk/files/nu/F1KS11.pdf)

## Introduction

This unit will give you an introduction to media types such as

* jpg
* png
* svg
* wav
* mp3
* mp4
* html

In order to pass this unit you will need to successfully complete the tasks as well as a test

## Image Formats

**JPEG** JPEG \( Joint Photographic Experts Group \) .jpg .jpeg Millions of colours, no transparency, lossy compression, can set level of compression.

**PNG** PNG \( Portable Network Graphics \) .png Millions of colours, transparency, lossless compression

**GIF** GIF \( Graphics Interchange Format \) .gif 256 Colours, dithering, transparency, animation

**BITMAP** BITMAP .bmp Uncompressed Image, Large Files

**SVG** \( Scalable Vector Graphics \) Vector Graphics Format, Scalability Shapes, Paths, Co-ordinates, Great for Logos, Bad for Photos, Interactivity

**SWF** \( Small Web Format \) Dated - Vector - Animation - Rich Interaction - Weak Security

## Video Formats

**MPEG 4** Motion Picture Experts Group .mp4 H.264 is the most common format for transmission online

H.265 a smaller format but takes more processing power to encode

**MPEG 2** Used to master DVD Video \( 4.7 GB \) and Blu-ray Disc \( 50 GB \)

**WebM** An opensource alternative to MP4

**Quicktime** .mov, Apples proprietary video format

**AVI** - .avi is a video container format - that can be used to hold many different codecs

## Audio Formats

There are many types of commonly used audio formats. Some include File Compression.

**.wav** Uncompressed Waveform - Large file size - High Quality

**.mp3** MPEG Layer-3, lossy compression and granular control of compression

**.ogg** Ogg Vorbis - an open source alternative to MP3

**.flac** A lossless audio format

**.aac** Apples propriety lossless audio format

**Sound Waves** We use two-dimensional visualizations to represent the physical phenomena of sound vibrations moving through the air.

The vertical axis of these representations is described as the amplitude, and can be more easily imagined as the volume.

The horizontal axis of these representations is described as the wavelength

## Html

Task 5 requires the use of basic html

### Images

```markup
<img src="filename">
```

### Audio

```markup
<audio controls>
  <source src="filename">
</audio>
```

### Video

```markup
<video controls>
  <source src="filename">
</video>
```

## **Compression**

#### **Lossy**         

* Control over file size
* Low quality
* Small files

**Lossless**    

* Bigger files
* High Quality
* Can't control file size

Lossless files are still much smaller than uncompressed files, but larger than lossy files.

## Copyright

Adhering to copyright law is essential at all times when working with images. Consequences of ignoring copyright includes fines and imprisonment.

If you take the photograph yourself then you will own the image and can sell and licence it.

**Royalty Free License** Pay Once for an image and then you can use it as much as you like after that.

**Rights-Managed License** The images must be use for a specific purpose; such as a specific website, magazine or advert. In order to use elsewhere, you would have to negotiate and purchase the rights again.

**Creative Commons** This license is free to use for non-commercial work but you will still need to attribute the author. There are many types of Creative Commons licences with different rules so it is important to make a note.

Creative Common Zero has no restrictions over how the images can be used.

**Important** You must be sure of were your images have come from, you must be able to reference them and prove their licence. There are lot's of websites that claim to host free to use images but are actually stolen from elsewhere. Only trustworthy sources can be used. If you are in any doubt then DO NOT USE the image.
