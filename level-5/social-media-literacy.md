## **History**

Web 2.0 

[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) is the idea that the internet transitions from a largely top down service to a user produced model - including social features like discussion, remix and redistributing. We largely see what used to be consider social features as basic features on all websites.

Friends Re-united - 1999 Friends re-united had a simple premise, to allow you to get in touch with friends from school, but, never quite got traction

Friendster - 2011 Friendster was the first of the social networks to resemble what we see today, it was a popular website with millions of users.
